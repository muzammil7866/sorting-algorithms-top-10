## 🚀 Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own `.cpp` file and can be compiled and run independently.

### Compilation

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
g++ bubbleSort.cpp -o bubbleSort
./bubbleSort
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
g++ bubbleSort.cpp -o bubbleSort.exe
.\bubbleSort.exe
```

### Troubleshooting Windows Compilation

If g++ doesn't create .exe files:

1. **Check if g++ is installed**: Run `g++ --version`
2. **Install MinGW-w64 or MSYS2** if not installed
3. **Add to PATH**: Add MinGW/MSYS2 bin folder to System PATH
4. **Restart terminal/VS Code** after changing PATH
5. **Check Windows Defender**: Antivirus may block .exe creation
   - Add your project folder to Windows Defender exclusions

### Alternative: Online Compilers (No Installation Required)

If you're having compilation issues, use these online compilers:

- **OnlineGDB**: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
- **Compiler Explorer**: https://godbolt.org/
- **Replit**: https://replit.com/languages/cpp

Simply copy-paste any .cpp file and run it online!

### Example for all algorithms

```bash
# Compile
g++ algorithm_name.cpp -o algorithm_name

# Run (Linux/Mac)
./algorithm_name

# Run (Windows)
algorithm_name.exe
```

## 📖 Algorithm Descriptions

### Comparison-Based Sorts

**Bubble Sort** (`bubbleSort.cpp`)
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they're in wrong order
- Simple but inefficient for large datasets
- Good for: Teaching, nearly sorted data

**Selection Sort** (`selectionSort.cpp`)
- Finds minimum element and places it at the beginning
- In-place but not stable
- Good for: Small datasets, minimal memory

**Insertion Sort** (`insertionSort.cpp`)
- Builds sorted array one element at a time
- Efficient for small or nearly sorted data
- Good for: Small datasets, online sorting

**Merge Sort** (`mergeSort.cpp`)
- Divides array, sorts halves, then merges
- Guaranteed O(n log n), stable
- Good for: Large datasets, linked lists, external sorting

**Quick Sort** (`quickSort.cpp`)
- Picks pivot, partitions around it, recursively sorts
- Fast average case, widely used
- Good for: Large datasets, in-memory sorting

**Heap Sort** (`heapSort.cpp`)
- Uses binary heap data structure
- Guaranteed O(n log n), in-place
- Good for: Memory-constrained systems

### Non-Comparison Sorts

**Counting Sort** (`countingSort.cpp`)
- Counts occurrences of each value
- Linear time for limited range of integers
- Good for: Integer sorting with small range

**Radix Sort** (`radixSort.cpp`)
- Sorts digits from least to most significant
- Linear time for fixed-length keys
- Good for: Strings, fixed-length integers

**Bucket Sort** (`bucketSort.cpp`)
- Distributes elements into buckets, sorts each
- Average linear time for uniform distribution
- Good for: Floating-point numbers, uniform data

**Shell Sort** (`shellSort.cpp`)
- Generalization of insertion sort with gap sequence
- Better than O(n²) with right gap sequence
- Good for: Medium-sized datasets, embedded systems
